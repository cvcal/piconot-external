# Monday 6th, in class
We redefined the ideal grammar and pseudo-coded it to see what should be a case 
class, and what should be a type.

# Wednesday 8th, in class
Started working on the Intermediate Representation and parser. We did not settle on a final IR, since the parsing step kept showing us that some things would work, and some wouldn't.

# Thursday 9th
Finished the parser. No major syntax changes yet. We realized we aren't taking 
much advantage of the external language capabilities, since we have such a 
simple type system.

#Saturday 11th
Implemented most of the semantics. We decided to implement using our internal 
DSL so we don't have to redo all of the mappings of Cardinal directions to
relative directions. One thing we do realize is that we now need to take care
of the "Anything" case, as we could have anywhere from 1-4 rules, where if there
are less than 4 rules the "Anything" has to take care of all of the remaining
rules. We spent a fair amount of time figuring out eclipse project type stuff. 
We ended up deciding to just include our internal DSL file rather than making
a jar as that would be easier when someone needs to download our source to not
need to get the jar too.

#Sunday 12th
As we are finishing up the semantics, we are realizing we used a lot of the same 
names as the original picolib. A lot of explicit calls does not look great, so
we decided to just rename some of our stuff in the AST.
